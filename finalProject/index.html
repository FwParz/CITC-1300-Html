                   <p>Welcome to my rock climbing starter guide! Here you'll learn how to safely climb in most situations. I'll cover the things you'll need for gym climbing, outdoor climbing, some very helpful knots that every climber should know, and finally how to take care of yourself so that you don't break yourself. This won't be a 100% guide but it should cover all the basics to get started grabbing some rocks. This doesnt cover lead climbing as that deserves its own website, and I dont know how.</p>
                   <p>Now what qualifies me to give this advice? Absolutely nothing! I'm just a dood that likes to climb and is kinda strong. I have 2 V6s under my belt and a V5 outside. I'm not huge on sport climbing and I dont have the training to lead, but I have sent a 5.12+ inside. If that made no sense to you, don't worry. If you end up trying rock climbing and decide you like it, you'll quickly learn where those ratings stand on the climbing scales.</p>
