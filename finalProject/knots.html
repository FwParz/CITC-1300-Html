               <h2 class="underscore">Bouldering Gear</h2>
                   <p>Alright so you decided that you want to climb in a gym. Now we need to get you some gear so you can be on the wall. First things first you'll need some climbing shoes. This is technically the bare minimum to climb but I'd recommend reading more to make the experience more comfortable for yourself. Most gyms allow you to rent almost all of this gear so no worries about buying it yourself.</p>
                   <img src="data/img/shoes.png" alt="shoes">

                   <p>Next you'll need some chalk and tape for yourself. This you will most likely have to buy. But I can assure you it's worth the investment. Chalk keeps your hands dry and grippy, You can never have enough of it. Tape can help prevent injuries or temporarily let you ignore them till your session is done. If your skin feels really thin or if you get a cut you can tape that bad boy up and continue on the wall.</p>
                   <table>
                       <tr>
                           <td><img src="data/img/chalk_bag.png" alt="chalk"></td>
                           <td><img src="data/img/tape.png" alt="tape"></td>
                       </tr>

               <h2 class="underscore">Top Rope Gear</h2>
                   <p>If you've decided you want to climb a little bit higher than bouldering allows i recommend you rent out a harness and try out sport climbing. The harness is meant to withstand 10 - 14 kilonewtons of force. Comparing this to the hardest fall you can take on a rope being roughly 3kn(roughly 700lbs!), it's almost impossible to break a harness.</p>
                   <img src="data/img/harness.png" alt="harness">

                   <p>Now if you're climbing alone these aren't necessary but if you have a friend you should totally get trained on an ATC. (which requires you to have a carabiner with you to operate) ATCs are what allow one person to belay another. To summarize, it allows you to make sure the other person doesn't fall to their doom. Most gyms will allow you to rent an atc and a carabiner as well, but i'd highly recommend you buy your own.</p>
