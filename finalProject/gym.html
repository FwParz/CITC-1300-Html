                   <p>Now what qualifies me to give this advice? Absolutely nothing! I'm just a dood that likes to climb and is kinda strong. I have 2 V6s under my belt and a V5 outside.

If you end up trying rock climbing and decide you like it, you'll quickly learn where those ratings stand on the climbing scales.</p>
