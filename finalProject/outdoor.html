               <h2 class="underscore">Bouldering Gear</h2>
                   <p>First things first don't forget to bring <strong>water</strong> and <strong>first aid</strong>! You never know how long you will be out there, or if someone will get injured.</p>
                   

                   <p>Now that you want to climb outside things get a little bit more expensive. If you haven't already bought all the gear from the gym climbing section I recommend you get it, as most places don't allow rentals to leave the gym. After you acquire the basics if you want to outdoor bouldery you need a crash pad. This is mandatory. Not having a crash pad makes climbing infinitely more dangerous and you will catch a lot of flack from the community. But this allows you to climb 15ft walls relatively safely and is all the safety gear you need to get started.</p>
                   <table class="table_img">
                       <tr>
                           <td><img src="data/img/crash_pad.png" alt="crash pad"></td>
                           <td><img src="data/img/lights.png" alt="lights"></td>
                       </tr>
                   </table>
                   <p>If the crash pad and basic gear took all your money but you're still crazy about climbing I highly recommend getting some cheap battery powered led flood lights. These bad boys will allow you to climb at night which makes the experience about 10x scarier and 15x more fun.</p>

           <div class="content">
               <h2 class="underscore">Top Rope Gear</h2>
               
                   <p>If you're more of a top rope kind of person and already have an act and the rest of the gear. 100% try outdoor top rope. The barrier of entry is just a rope too! I'd recommend a 9.8mm x 30ft for your first one. This is a pretty hefty rope that won't cut or get fuzzy easily and will allow yourself to climb some 15-20ft walls. Rope expands by about 10% when under tension so a 30ft rope can go up and down a 20ft wall. You should also get a rope bag to keep the rope clean and easy to carry but it's not necessary.</p>
                   <table>
                       <tr>
                           <td><img src="data/img/rope.png" alt="rope"></td>
                           <td><img src="data/img/rope_bag.png" alt="rope rope_bag"></td>
                           <td class="tablet"><img src="data/img/helmet.png" alt="helmet"></td>
                       </tr>
                   </table>

                   <p>If the terrain is harder than a 5.8 or 9 you should really get a helmet too. It's not as necessary as a crash pad in bouldering but your head is fragile and the last thing you want is to take a fall and accidentally break your brain in a not cool way.</p>
